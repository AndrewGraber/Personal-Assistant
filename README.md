# Personal-Assistant
A voice activated "personal assistant" I've been working on using pyttx, speech_recognition, and Tkinter. This was created using Python 2.7 on Windows 10. Other versions not guaranteed to work.

## Getting it working on your computer:
1) Install python 2.7, which can be found [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
2) Install pyttsx, speech_recognition, and pocketsphinx using pip. If you don't know how to use pip or other ways to get python libraries, google is a good resource.
3) Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/AndrewGraber/Personal-Assistant.git`
4) Do whatever you want to it using your favorite editor (IDLE, PyCharm, Vim, whatever)

I've been having fun making this so far, and I hope you guys like messing around with it too. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, feel free to post them in the issues.

Also, I don't remember where I got those sounds, or if they're copyrighted. If they belong to you and you don't want me to use them, please don't sue me. I'll happily remove them.
